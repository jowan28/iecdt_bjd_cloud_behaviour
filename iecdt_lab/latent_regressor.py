"""
This file will contain functionality to aim to identify a the set of basis vectors of an embedding space that represent the cloud cover metric.

This is to be done via training a model on the embedding space as input, and cloud cover as the label. The network will consist of a single fully connected layer of one node, by analysising the trained weights we can determine the key embedding state vectors that make up the cloud coverage component.
